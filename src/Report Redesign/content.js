        "As a result, many patients turn to Google in search of answers. This is like trying to find a needle in a haystack:",
        "Since the information is not tailored to their unique cancer, they have to deduce what applies to them and what doesn’t.",

    context: "The Yerbba Report provides breast cancer patients with personalized information including treatment options, cancer traits, and action items. When Yerbba brought me on board, the Yerbba Report was up and running. But most of the focus had been on making the back-end functional. Not much thought had been given to the user experience.  My job was simple - research, design, and build a completely new Yerbba Report that breast cancer patients would actually want to buy and use."
